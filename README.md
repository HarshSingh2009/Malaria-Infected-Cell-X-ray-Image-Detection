# Malaria-Infected-Cell-X-ray-Image-Detection
### Detects if a person is facing malaria disease using X-ray images of Cells!! Powered by Transfer Learning (Resnet152V2 model) which gave us an accuracy of 95.5%

Note: I am not able to give you the models for this project since they are very big and my data quota is over!! But I will build a project soon that's gonna detect multipl diseases using C.T scans, in which I will include it!!
